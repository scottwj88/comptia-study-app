        "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a Windows 10 PC that fails to boot and displays the error message 'Boot Configuration Data is missing'. The technician boots into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and opens a command prompt. Which command should be executed FIRST to attempt repairing the BCD store?",
        "options": ["bootrec /fixmbr", "bootrec /rebuildbcd", "sfc /scannow", "chkdsk /r"],
        "answer": "bootrec /rebuildbcd",
        "explanation": "While '/fixmbr' writes a new master boot record, the specific error indicates missing BCD data. 'bootrec /rebuildbcd' scans all disks for installations and allows you to add them back to the BCD store, directly addressing the error."

        "answer": "Smishing with executive impersonation",
        "explanation": "This is a text-message-based phishing attack (Smishing). It utilizes impersonation of a high-level executive (CEO) and creates a sense of urgency to pressure the employee."

        "options": ["Run a full antivirus scan", "Update anti-malware definitions", "Disable System Restore", "Educate the end user"],
        "answer": "Disable System Restore",
        "explanation": "Step 3, after quarantine (Step 2), is to disable System Restore. This prevents the malware from hiding in restore points, ensuring that if you need to restore later, you don't re-infect the system."

        "answer": "Clear the application cache and data",
        "explanation": "Clearing the app's cache and data often resolves corruption issues specific to that app. It's a less invasive step than a factory reset, which should be a last resort."

        "answer": "Full Disk Encryption (e.g., BitLocker)",
        "explanation": "A login password only stops someone from logging in; it doesn't encrypt the data at rest. Full Disk Encryption (FDE) ensures the data on the drive is unreadable without the decryption key, even if removed."

        "answer": "A scheduled full system antivirus scan is running in the background",
        "explanation": "Background system processes, like a Windows update installation, an indexing service, or a full antivirus scan, are common causes for high disk usage that might not immediately be obvious just by looking at running apps."
